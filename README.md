# Paramore Band Website
An aesthetically pleasing and attractive website targeted towards Paramore Fans to
get information and updates about the Band and even buy their own Paramore Merchandise and Albums.

## Design Process
#### Insights about The Design Process
I wanted to create a website where the color and the atmosphere of the website
speaks Paramore. I decided on orange and purple as Paramore has a lot of orange and purple
themed albums and also Hayley's makeup, lead vocalist.

#### Target Audience
The site's users are fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about the band's 
history and the band members, and possibly book them for shows. 

#### Needs of Target Audience and how does the website achieve them?
